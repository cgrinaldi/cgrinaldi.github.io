![Picture of me]({filename}/images/me.jpg)

My name is **Chris Rinaldi** and I am a data scientist who loves building data-driven products. This blog serves as a dumping ground for a range of topics that interest me, including data science, programming, and anything else that happens to catch my fancy.

Also, I am a proud cat dad!
