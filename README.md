# The Blog of Chris Rinaldi

We'll see if I actually write anything, but it was fun to setup with
[Pelican](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/).

## Additional Information

A lot of useful info can be found from the
[theme](http://oncrashreboot.com/elegant-best-pelican-theme-features) that I
forked.

The generated site's repo is
[here](https://github.com/cgrinaldi/cgrinaldi.github.io).
